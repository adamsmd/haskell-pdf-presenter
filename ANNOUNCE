Next week I will be making a public release of the Haskell Pdf
Presenter.  Before that happens, I am releasing a special tech preview
to close friends and colleagues.  If you have any suggestions or
feedback before the public release, please let me know.

Below is the draft announcement to be sent to the Haskell and Haskell
Cafe mailing lists.  The Hackage link won't work yet, but you can
access the package candidate at:

What is it
==========
The Haskell Pdf Presenter (hpdfp) is a tool for presenting PDF based
slide shows.  For example, as a presenter, I like to see the next slide
before it is shown to the audience as well as how much allotted time
remains.  I was never quite satisfied with the existing tools for this,
so I wrote my own and hpdfp is the result.

Though I originally wrote it for my own use, the tool has matured over
time, and I now wish to share it with others.  Aside from being a
useful tool, I think hpdfp is a good example of elegance and economy
in program design.  Despite being only a thousand lines long, this
program is full of features that may not be obvious at first glance so
please be sure to look at the available help.

Status
======
I've been using this tool in my own talks for over a year now, and
it is fairly stable and feature complete.  I've only tested it on
Ubuntu so I don't know if it ports to other platforms.  I'd love to
hear any field reports about how it runs on other platforms.

Future Directions
=================
I have a long TODO list of ideas I may implement in the future, but
most development has been driven by the practical considerations that
I discover as a use the tool.  If you have a use case for a particular
feature, please let me know.

================

Feature requests, bug reports, suggestions or feedback as well as
contributions to the documentation or implementation are most welcome.
