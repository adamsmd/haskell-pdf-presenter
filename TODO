Naming convention
---------

cabal
~/build/slider
  Pens in different colors and sizes (2, 8, 32 pixels)

Overlay (skipped on back)
Movies
Black slide after end

++About dialog w/ help - on ?/h/ctrl-h key
++Better error messages
++Filter cache
  - Wipe on reload
+Disable suppression of screen saver?  Suppress screen saver only if full screen? Only if focused?
Command line split percentage needs to be one of the stops
If single screen, then put audience on top
Swap screens (just go do non-fullscreen and manually swap?)
Click on audience = advance slide
Scroll: Right/Down vs Left/Up
scroll up/down (zoom presenter(?))
mouse wheel? select slide? select color? zoom?

    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/967193
    Focus (bring to front?) audience window on either one being focused (brought to front?)
+Ctrl-Z minimizes:
  Send-to-back or minimize button: ctrl-z?
+Command line option to change base font of metadata
Auto-Stops on preview panes:
  +, -, =, ctrl--, ctrl-+ for small movement
+Note mode (status? vertically divided box? SQUARE WITH LEFT HALF BLACK?):
  Keyboard toggle: /, |
  only show left half in thumbs and audience and preview next, but show right half in preview current
  guess on startup based on aspect ratio (>= 2) (fails if vertical pages)

      -u, --current-size=N          Percentage of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide. (Default 60)
      -s, --switch-screens          Switch the presentation and the presenter screen.
      -c, --disable-cache           Disable caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost of speed.
      -z, --disable-compression     Disable the compression of slide images to trade memory consumption for speed. (Avg. factor 30)

Any key gets out of mute mode?
test if works on MS Windows
  Use of URI may be a problem
  Basename may be a problem
zoom?
drawing? (w/ colors, undo, clear, cursor shape, on fresh slide)
hilight cursor? big cursor? cursor shape?
mouse cursor on audience vs presenter screen (click on audience, means next, on presenter means select)

Does alt-tab do both presenter and audience? (if one window is foregound, then both should be?)
What would ctrl-tab mean? switch to other pdf? switch mouse to presenter vs audience? swap presenter and audience windows?
switch to demo
vim or arrow key navigation on overview screen
