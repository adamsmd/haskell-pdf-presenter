Record:
  - timer settings
  + slide number adjustment

Set boarder of time on even seconds
  - Setting underline doesn't work (it is below the screen)
  - Change color of text foreground?

-- "Yes" button: Certain keys go to certain slides or to fixed text
 - Ctrl-Shift Y = Yes
 -- Store shortcuts in F11 keys (or alpha keys? shifted?)

test if works on MS Windows
  Use of URI may be a problem
  Basename may be a problem

Naming convention

---------

~/build/slider
  Pens in different colors and sizes (2, 8, 32 pixels)
  Zoom on individual slide
Test multi-monitor on Xfce4

+Freeze (it's like a mute mode)
Overlay (skipped on back)
Movies
Single screen

Config dialog (for compression(ick requires reload), anti-screen saver, mouse hiding, colors)

++Better error messages
Command line split percentage needs to be one of the stops
Click on audience = advance slide
Scroll: Right/Down vs Left/Up
scroll up/down (zoom presenter(?))
mouse wheel? select slide? select color? zoom?
Toggle Fullscreen:
  use instead of refresh screen
  full screen all (some?)
  Menubar shadow:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/967193
    Focus (bring to front?) audience window on either one being focused (brought to front?)
+Ctrl-Z minimizes:
  Send-to-back or minimize button: ctrl-z?
+Command line option to change base font of metadata
+Note mode (status? vertically divided box? SQUARE WITH LEFT HALF BLACK?):
  Keyboard toggle: /, |
  only show left half in thumbs and audience and preview next, but show right half in preview current
  guess on startup based on aspect ratio (>= 2) (fails if vertical pages)

      -c, --disable-cache           Disable caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost of speed.

Any key gets out of mute mode?
zoom?
drawing? (w/ colors, undo, clear, cursor shape, on fresh slide)
hilight cursor? big cursor? cursor shape?
mouse cursor on audience vs presenter screen (click on audience, means next, on presenter means select)

Does alt-tab do both presenter and audience? (if one window is foregound, then both should be?)
What would ctrl-tab mean? switch to other pdf? switch mouse to presenter vs audience? swap presenter and audience windows?
switch to demo
vim or arrow key navigation on overview screen

================
Features (non-active)
================

Record slide timing (print to stdout?)
  Record everything except window manager events
  Print to stdout as you go
  Pause recording (R?) - show status in meta-data
  Print timer status changes
  Print presenter dispaly changes
  Implementation:?
    Always send all events to stdout with absolute time
    Read events from stdin and play back those events
    For portability, events must be internal names (e.g., Advance Slide) not keyboard names (e.g. PageDown)

Replay slides (status? three-quarters circle arrow? recycle symbol?):
  read from stdin or file or cmd line
  Start/stop/rewind replay (status?)
    Separate dialog?

Multiple pdf files: (usefull for lightning talks)
  store filename and current slide number of non-loaded
  Switch via Ctrl-TAB
  Seperate timers?

Annotation mode (status?)

-- hyperlinks (mouse cursor when hover): both Pdf-Presenter and pympress are useful to learn from here

Sync with Audio recording (audio mark?)
  Say "mark" and then press "P" key loudly?
