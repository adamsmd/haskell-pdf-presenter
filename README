    - Backward slide: back space, page up, left arrow, up arrow
    - First slide: home
    - Last slide: end
    - Goto slide number: Ctrl-g, double click enty box (direct edit of entry box is buggy)
  - Files:

  all poppler work is done in the render thread or in a postGUISync from the render thread

Features (TODO)
==================

Blanking
Hide mouse
Swap screens
Click on audience = advance slide
Click on timer = adjust time (?)
Timer:
  Pause: pause, p
  Add 1 minute: + (?)
  Reset timer: t
  Wall clock
  Time elapsed
Command line:
Toggle Fullscreen (F, F11, Alt-Enter, Ctrl-l)
History: Alt-left, Alt-right, XF86Back, XF86Forward
Auto-Stops on preview
Record slide timing (print to stdout?)
  Print to stdout as you go
  Pause recording (R?) - show status in meta-data
Replay slides (read from stdin or file or cmd line)
Multiple pdf files:
  store filename and current slide number of non-loaded
  Switch via Ctrl-TAB
  Seperate timers?
Note mode:
  only show left half in thumbs and audience and preview next, but show right half in preview current
  guess on startup based on aspect ratio (>= 2) (fails if vertical pages)
About dialog
Scroll: Right/Down vs Left/Up
Bounded pre-render: Maybe Int (number of slides to pre-render (2/3 will be in front, 1/3 will be behind))
Fonts should be 36pt or 44pt (48?) (not 40pt):
  Use AttrScale or <big>(multiple times?)
Screen saver:
  xdg-screensaver suspend WindowID
  xset -dpms (avoid dimming?)
  xset s off
'Escape' exits full screen instead of quits
Default preview to one of the stops: best left, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, best right

      -d, --duration=N              Duration in minutes of the presentation used for timer display. (Default 45 minutes)
      -l, --last-minutes=N          Time in minutes, from which on the timer changes its color. (Default 5 minutes)
      -u, --current-size=N          Percentage of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide. (Default 60)
      -s, --switch-screens          Switch the presentation and the presenter screen.
      -c, --disable-cache           Disable caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost of speed.
      -z, --disable-compression     Disable the compression of slide images to trade memory consumption for speed. (Avg. factor 30)

-- Look at fullscreen.vala

-- L (last)
-- Tab (overview)
-- Time tracking mode
-- Any key gets out of mute mode?
-- Store shortcuts in F11 keys (or alpha keys? shifted?)
-- help, h, ?
-- scroll up/down (zoom presenter(?): duplicate, timer, next slide, minor overview, major overview)

-- Timer:
-- initial page (for startup)
-- start counter with "back"
-- pause timer
-- elapsed vs remaining time vs time of day

-- disable screen saver
-- disable screen dimming
-- hyperlinks (mouse cursor when hover): both Pdf-Presenter and pympress are useful to learn from here
-- test if works on MS Windows
-- zoom?
-- drawing? (w/ colors, undo, clear, cursor shape, on fresh slide)
-- "Yes" button
-- follow link (ALT-left, ALT-right)
-- overview in the presenter view:
--   - possibly along with current
--   - could have cool zoom out effect
--   - partial zoom out
-- windowed (non-fullscreen)?
-- switch to demo
-- vim or arrow key navigation on overview screen
-- hilight cursor? big cursor? cursor shape?
-- mouse wheel? select slide? select color? zoom?
-- mouse cursor on audience vs presenter screen (click on audience, means next, on presenter means select)
-- set boarder of time on even seconds
-- send-to-back or minimize button

-- does alt-tab do both presenter and audience? (if one window is foregound, then both should be?)
-- what would ctrl-tab mean? switch to other pdf? switch mouse to presenter vs audience? swap presenter and audience windows?

-- page numbers on each tile in tile view

-- adjust ending time
-- adjust durration
-- end time = start time + durration (dynamically update?)
