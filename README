This application is a viewer for presenting PDF files that contain a set of slides.



***********
* WARNING *

By default this application disables both the screen saver and
automatic screen dimming.  If you want to conserve battery,
then pass the "TODO" flag or press "TODO".

======================
Features (Implemented)
======================

- Presenter view
  - Metadata:
    - Fonts are big (60pt = 5 * 12pt)
    - Resizeable
    - Timer:
      - Grows to fit size (usefull for session chairs)
      - Colors: white, red (warning), purple (overtime)
          Yeah, these colors are a bit strange, but I've chosen them to
          be easily distinguishale even in paripheral vision or at a
          glance.  I don't know how well they work for color-blind
          people.  Feedback is welcome.
      - Double click to configure timer
        - Current remaining time
        - Initial time
        - Warning time
    - Slide counter
      - Double click to go to slide
    - Mute status
    - Timer status
      - When paused (but not stopped) automatically goes to running if user
        goes forward or backward one slide.  Changing slide in other ways does not unpause.
      - NOTE: to start timer but stay on first slide, just hit the back key
  - Preview
  - Thumbnails
    - Current slide highlighted
    - Tooltips show slide number
    - Click to go to slide
    - Mouse wheel scrolls instead of changes slide

- Audience view
  - Mouse hides after ~3 seconds

- Rendering
  - Separeate rendering thread
  - slide number or file name until rendered
  - Renders slide close to current slide first (at a rate of two forward per one backward)

- Keybindings:
  - Switching slides:
    - Forward slide (and unpause): space, page down, enter, right arrow, down arrow
    - Backward slide (and unpause): back space, page up, left arrow, up arrow
    - First slide: home
    - Last slide: end
    - Goto slide number: Ctrl-g, double click enty box (direct edit of entry box is buggy)
    - History back: Alt-L, XF86Back
    - History forward: Alt-R, XF86Forward
  - Timer control:
    - Toggle pause: p, pause
    - Reset timer: t
    - Open timer dialog: Ctrl-t
  - Mute:
    - Toggle white: w
    - Toggle black: b
  - Presenter screen:
    - Switch views: tab
    - Change preview percentage: [, ], Shift-[ (minor), Shift-] (minor), = (standard stops)
      - Standard stops: 0, best left, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, best right, 1
    - Change preview percentage to standard
  - Files:
    - Reload file: Ctrl-r
    - Open file: Ctrl-o
  - Quit: Alt-F4, Ctrl-q
  - Enter fullscreen: f, F11, Alt-Enter, Control-l
  - Exit fullscreen: Escape, f, F11, Alt-Enter, Control-l
  - Help/About dialog: h, ?

- Command line:
  - Zero or one files as argument:
    - NOTE: Zero files is useful for creating a simple timer with no slides
  - Initial time: --durations
  - Warning time: --warning
  - Initial slide: --initial-slide
  - Initial mute: --mute-black, --mute-white, --mute-off
  - Start in fullscreen: --fullscreen, -f
  - Help: --help, -h, -?
  - Compression level: --compress

- Since poppler is not thread safe (see https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50992),
  all poppler work is done in the render thread or in a postGUISync from the render thread

- Disables screen saver when running in fullscreen mode
  - WARNING: This is done by programatically giggling the mouse by zero pixels (even when running in the background).
    This may lead to other programs thinking the mouse is constantly moving
    (e.g. a video player may not dim the background or hide the mouse).
    I haven't found any programs where this is an actual problem, but it is a possibility.

Naming convention
---------

cabal
~/build/slider
  Pens in different colors and sizes (2, 8, 32 pixels)
  Zoom on individual slide
Test multi-monitor on Xfce4

NOTE: Memory performance is *much* better now

=Shift to jump by ten
=(Default timer of zero?)
+Freeze (it's like a mute mode)
+Notes mode
+Rendering status icon
Overlay (skipped on back)
Movies
Black slide after end
Single screen

Config dialog (for compression(ick requires reload), anti-screen saver, mouse hiding, colors)

++About dialog w/ help - on ?/h/ctrl-h key
++Better error messages
++Filter cache
  - Wipe on reload
+Disable suppression of screen saver?  Suppress screen saver only if full screen? Only if focused?
Command line split percentage needs to be one of the stops
If single screen, then put audience on top
Swap screens (just go do non-fullscreen and manually swap?)
Click on audience = advance slide
Scroll: Right/Down vs Left/Up
scroll up/down (zoom presenter(?))
mouse wheel? select slide? select color? zoom?
Timer:
  ++Initial status
  Wall clock (mode?)
  Time elapsed
Toggle Fullscreen:
  use instead of refresh screen
  full screen all (some?)
  Menubar shadow:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/967193
    Focus (bring to front?) audience window on either one being focused (brought to front?)

Auto-Stops on preview panes:
  +, -, =, ctrl--, ctrl-+ for small movement

  Keyboard toggle: /, |
  only show left half in thumbs and audience and preview next, but show right half in preview current
  guess on startup based on aspect ratio (>= 2) (fails if vertical pages)

      -u, --current-size=N          Percentage of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide. (Default 60)
      -s, --switch-screens          Switch the presentation and the presenter screen.
      -c, --disable-cache           Disable caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost of speed.
      -z, --disable-compression     Disable the compression of slide images to trade memory consumption for speed. (Avg. factor 30)

Any key gets out of mute mode?
test if works on MS Windows
  Use of URI may be a problem
  Basename may be a problem
zoom?
drawing? (w/ colors, undo, clear, cursor shape, on fresh slide)
hilight cursor? big cursor? cursor shape?
mouse cursor on audience vs presenter screen (click on audience, means next, on presenter means select)

Does alt-tab do both presenter and audience? (if one window is foregound, then both should be?)
What would ctrl-tab mean? switch to other pdf? switch mouse to presenter vs audience? swap presenter and audience windows?
switch to demo
vim or arrow key navigation on overview screen
