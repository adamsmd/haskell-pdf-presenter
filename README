  - slide number or file name until rendered
  - Renders slide close to current slide first (at a rate of two forward per one backward)

- Keybindings:
  - Forward slide: space, page down, enter, right arrow, down arrow
  - Backward slide: back space, page up, left arrow, up arrow
  - First slide: home
  - Last slide: end
  - Reload file: r
  - Open file: Ctrl-o
  - Switch views: tab

  all poppler work is done in the render thread or in a postGUISync from the render thread
