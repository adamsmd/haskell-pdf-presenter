======================
Features (Implemented)
======================

- Presenter view
  - Metadata:
    - Fonts are big (60pt = 5 * 12pt)
    - Timer:
      - Colors: white, red (warning), purple (overtime)
          Yeah, these colors are a bit strange, but I've chosen them to
          be easily distinguishale even in paripheral vision or at a
          glance.  I don't know how well they work for color-blind
          people.  Feedback is welcome.
      - Double click to configure timer
    - Slide counter
      - Double click to go to slide
    - Mute status
    - Timer status
  - Preview
  - Thumbnails
    - Current slide hilighted
    - Click to go to slide
    - Mouse wheel scrolls instead of changes slide

- Rendering
  - Separeate rendering thread
  - slide number or file name until rendered
  - Renders slide close to current slide first (at a rate of two forward per one backward)

- Keybindings:
  - Switching slides:
    - Forward slide: space, page down, enter, right arrow, down arrow
    - Backward slide: back space, page up, left arrow, up arrow
    - First slide: home
    - Last slide: end
    - Goto slide number: Ctrl-g, double click enty box (direct edit of entry box is buggy)
  - Timer control:
    - Toggle pause: p, pause
  - Mute:
    - Toggle white: w
    - Toggle black: b
  - Files:
    - Reload file: r
    - Open file: Ctrl-o
  - Presenter screen:
    - Switch views: tab
    - Change preview percentage: [, ], Shift-[ (minor), Shift-] (minor)
  - Quit: Alt-F4, Ctrl-q

- Command line:
  - one files as (required) argument

- Since poppler is not thread safe (see https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50992),
  all poppler work is done in the render thread or in a postGUISync from the render thread

==================
Features (TODO)
==================

Sync with Audio recording (audio mark?)
If single screen, then put audience on top
++Hide mouse: only in full screen mode?
++Soft pause (Paused vs Stopped)
Swap screens
Click on audience = advance slide
Click on timer = adjust time (?)
Timer:
  Dialog: warning time, total time, time remaining (use grid (labels on left, entries on right); same for slide selection)
  +command line option
  +Reset timer: t
  Wall clock
  Time elapsed
Command line:
+Toggle Fullscreen (F, F11, Alt-Enter, Ctrl-l):
  use instead of refresh screen
  full screen all (some?)
  Menubar shadow:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/967193
    Focus (bring to front?) audience window on either one being focused (brought to front?)
+Ctrl-Z minimizes
+Resizeable meta-data
  +Command line option to change base font
History: Alt-left, Alt-right, XF86Back, XF86Forward
Auto-Stops on preview panes:
  +, -, =, ctrl--, ctrl-+ for small movement
Record slide timing (print to stdout?)
  Record everything except window manager events
  Print to stdout as you go
  Pause recording (R?) - show status in meta-data
  Print timer status changes
  Print presenter dispaly changes
Replay slides (status? three-quarters circle arrow? recycle symbol?):
  read from stdin or file or cmd line
  Start/stop/rewind replay (status?)
    Separate dialog?
Multiple pdf files:
  store filename and current slide number of non-loaded
  Switch via Ctrl-TAB
  Seperate timers?
Annotation mode (status?)
Note mode (status? vertically divided box? SQUARE WITH LEFT HALF BLACK?):
  Keyboard toggle: /, |
  only show left half in thumbs and audience and preview next, but show right half in preview current
  guess on startup based on aspect ratio (>= 2) (fails if vertical pages)
About dialog
Scroll: Right/Down vs Left/Up
Bounded pre-render: Maybe Int (number of slides to pre-render (2/3 will be in front, 1/3 will be behind))
+Screen saver:
  xdg-screensaver suspend WindowID
  xset -dpms (avoid dimming?)
  xset s off
        bus = dbus.SessionBus()
        self.ss = bus.get_object('org.gnome.ScreenSaver','/org/gnome/ScreenSaver')
        self.cookie = None
        self.cookie = self.ss.Inhibit("Disable Screensaver", "That's what I do.")
        self.ss.UnInhibit(self.cookie)
  look in mplayer source code
  move mouse pointer?
  +displayGetPointer/displayWarpPointer/windowGetScreen/screenGetDisplay
'Escape' exits full screen instead of quits
Default preview to one of the stops: best left, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, best right
Resizeable meta-data (  let attrs = 
scale font to fit)

      -u, --current-size=N          Percentage of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide. (Default 60)
      -s, --switch-screens          Switch the presentation and the presenter screen.
      -c, --disable-cache           Disable caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost of speed.
      -z, --disable-compression     Disable the compression of slide images to trade memory consumption for speed. (Avg. factor 30)

But icons on timer dialog

-- Look at fullscreen.vala

-- Time tracking mode
-- Any key gets out of mute mode?
-- Store shortcuts in F11 keys (or alpha keys? shifted?)
-- help, h, ?
-- scroll up/down (zoom presenter(?): duplicate, timer, next slide, minor overview, major overview)

-- Timer:
-- initial page (for startup)
-- start counter with "back"
-- pause timer
-- elapsed vs remaining time vs time of day

-- hyperlinks (mouse cursor when hover): both Pdf-Presenter and pympress are useful to learn from here
-- test if works on MS Windows
--  Use of URI may be a problem
--  Basename may be a problem
-- zoom?
-- drawing? (w/ colors, undo, clear, cursor shape, on fresh slide)
-- "Yes" button
-- overview in the presenter view:
--   - possibly along with current
--   - could have cool zoom out effect
--   - partial zoom out
-- windowed (non-fullscreen)?
-- switch to demo
-- vim or arrow key navigation on overview screen
-- hilight cursor? big cursor? cursor shape?
-- mouse wheel? select slide? select color? zoom?
-- mouse cursor on audience vs presenter screen (click on audience, means next, on presenter means select)
-- set boarder of time on even seconds
-- send-to-back or minimize button: ctrl-z?

-- does alt-tab do both presenter and audience? (if one window is foregound, then both should be?)
-- what would ctrl-tab mean? switch to other pdf? switch mouse to presenter vs audience? swap presenter and audience windows?

-- page numbers on each tile in tile view

-- adjust ending time
-- adjust durration
-- end time = start time + durration (dynamically update?)
